# More Printing

# prints each string in a newline
puts 'Mary had a little lamb.'
puts "Its fleece was white as #{'snow'}"
puts 'And everywhere that Mary went.'

# repeats n times the string given
puts '*' * 10 # what'd that do?

# Assign a string to a variable
end1 = 'C'
end2 = 'h'
end3 = 'e'
end4 = 'e'
end5 = 's'
end6 = 'e'
end7 = 'B'
end8 = 'u'
end9 = 'r'
end10 = 'g'
end11 = 'e'
end12 = 'r'

# watch that print vs. puts on this line what's it do?
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6 # print, prints all values in oneline
puts end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12 # the same as above, each value on a newline

# Study Drills

# 1) Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.

# 2) Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors.

# 3) From now on, when you make mistakes, write down on a piece of paper what
#    kind of mistake you made.

# 4) When you go to the next exercise, look at the mistakes you have made and
#    try not to make them in this new one.

# 5) Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who
#    fool everyone into thinking they are perfect and never wrong, but it's all
#    an act. They make mistakes all the time.
