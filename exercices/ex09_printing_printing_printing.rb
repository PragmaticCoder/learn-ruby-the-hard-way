# Printing, printing, printing

# Here's some new strange strugg, remember type it exactly.

days = 'Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun'

# the "\n" is an escape character that creates a newline
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

puts "Heree are the days: #{days}"
puts "Here are the months:#{months}"

# the %q{...} is used for printing oneline or multiline text with both single and double quotes
puts %q{
  There's sometihng going on here.
  With this wird quote
  We'll be able to type as much as we like.
  Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
}

# Study Drills

# 1) Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.

# 2) Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors.

# 3) From now on, when you make mistakes, write down on a piece of paper what
#    kind of mistake you made.

# 4) When you go to the next exercise, look at the mistakes you have made and
#    try not to make them in this new one.

# 5) Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who
#    fool everyone into thinking they are perfect and never wrong, but it's all
#    an act. They make mistakes all the time.
