ruby. You'll find here the exercises and my solutions to each one of the drills
presented in the book.

> Learn Ruby The Hard Way is the same highly popular way for total beginners to
> finally learn how to code but for the Ruby programming language. Learn Ruby
> The Hard Way takes you from absolute zero to able to read and write basic Ruby
> to then understand other books on Ruby. No experience necessary to begin, and
> you can even try the book out for free to see if the method works for you. If
> you've always wanted to learn to code but have no idea where to begin, then
> this book is for you.
